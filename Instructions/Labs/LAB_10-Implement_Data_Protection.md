# Lab 10 - Implement Data Protection

## Lab introduction    

In this lab, you learn about backup and recovery of Azure virtual machines. You learn to create a Recovery Service vault and a backup policy for Azure virtual machines. You learn about disaster recovery with Azure Site Recovery. 

This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the regions, but the steps are written using **East US** and **West US**.

## Estimated timing: 50 minutes

## Lab scenario

Your organization is evaluating how to backup and restore Azure virtual machines from accidental or malicious data loss. Additionally, the organization wants to explore using Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery scenarios. 

## Interactive lab simulation

There is an interactive lab simulation that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

    >**Note**: This setting can be configured only if there are no existing backup items.
    
    >**Did you know?** The [Cross Region Restore](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/backup/backup-create-recovery-services-vault#set-cross-region-restore) option allows you to restore data in a secondary, Azure paired region. 

1. Return to the Recovery Services vault blade, click the **Update** link under **Security Settings** label.

1. On the **Security Settings** blade, note that **Soft Delete (For workload running in Azure)** is **Enabled**. Notice the **soft delete retention period** is **14** days. 

1. Return to the Recovery Services vault blade, select the **Overview** blade.

>**Did you know?** Azure has two types of vaults: Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. The main difference is the datasources that can be backed up. Learn more about [the differences](https://learn.microsoft.com/answers/questions/405915/what-is-difference-between-recovery-services-vault).

## Task 3: Configure Azure virtual machine-level backup

In this task, you will implement Azure virtual-machine level backup. As part of a VM backup, you will need to define the backup and retention policy that applies to the backup. Different VMs can have different backup and retention policies assigned to them.

   >**Note**: Before you start this task, make sure that the deployment you initiated in the first task of this lab has successfully completed.

1. On the Recovery Services vault blade, click **Overview**, then click **+ Backup**.

1. On the **Backup Goal** blade, specify the following settings:

    | Settings | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Where is your workload running? | **Azure** (notice your other options) |
    | What do you want to backup? | **Virtual machine** (notice your other options |

1. Select **Backup**.

1. Notice there a two **Policy sub types**: **Enhanced** and **Standard**. Review the choices and select **Standard**. 

1. In **Backup policy**, select **Create a new policy**.

1. Define a new backup policy with the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    | Setting | Value |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | Policy name | `az104-backup` |
    | Frequency | **Daily** |
    | Time | **12:00 AM** |
    | Timezone | the name of your local time zone |

    - **Addon Azure Backup Alert Data**
    - **Azure Site Recovery Jobs**
    - **Azure Site Recovery Events**
    - **Health**

1. In the Destination details, place a checkmark next to **Archive to a storage account**.

1. In the Storage account drop-down field, select the storage account that you deployed earlier in this task.

1. Select **Save**.

1. Return to your Recovery Services vault, in the **Monitoring** blade select **Backup jobs**.

1. Locate the backup operation for the **az104-10-vm0** virtual machine. 

1. Review the details of the backup job.

## Task 5: Enable virtual machine replication

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select `Recovery Services vaults` and, on the **Recovery Services vaults** blade, click **+ Create**.

1. On the **Create Recovery Services vault** blade, specify the following settings:

    | Settings | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | the name of your Azure subscription |
    | Resource group | `az104-rg-region2` (If necessary, select **Create new**) |
    | Vault Name | `az104-rsv-region2` |
    | Region | **West US** |

    >**Note**: Make sure that you specify a **different** region than the virtual machine.

1. Click **Review + Create**, ensure that the validation passes and then click **Create**.

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. The deployment should take a couple of minutes. 

1. Search for and select the `az104-10-vm0` virtual machine.

1. In the **Operations** blade, select **Disaster recovery**. 

1. Select **Enable replication**.

1. On the **Basics** tab, notice the **Target region**.

1. Move to the **Advanced settings** tab. Resource selections have been made for you. It is important to review them. 

1. Verify your subscription, vm resource group, virtual network, and availability (take the default) settings.

1. In **Storage settings** select **Show details**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ---- | ---- |
    | Churn for the vm | **Normal churn**  |
    | Cache storage account | **(new) xxx**  |

   >**Note:** It is important that both of these settings be populated or the validation will fail. If values are not present, try refreshing the page. If that doesn't work, create an empty storage account and then return to this page.

1. In **Replication settings** select **Show details**. Notice your recovery resources vault in region 2 was automatically selected.

1. Select **Review + Start replication** and then **Enable replication**.

    >**Note**: Enabling replication will take a 10-15 minutes. Watch the notification messages in the upper right of the portal. While you wait, consider reviewing the self-paced training links at the end of this page.
    
1. Once the replication is complete, search for and locate your Recovery Services Vault, **az104-rsv-region2**. You may need to **Refresh** the page. 

1. In the **Protected items** section, select **Replicated items**.

1. Check that the virtual machine is showing as healthy for the replication health. Note that the status will show the synchronization (starting at 0%) status and ultimately show **Protected** after the initial synchronization completes.

   ![Screenshot of the replicated items page.](../media/az104-lab10-replicated-items.png)

1. Select the virtual machine to view more details.
   
>**Did you know?** It is a good practice to [test the failover of a protected VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-dr-drill-azure#run-a-test-failover-for-a-single-vm).

## Cleanup your resources

If you are working with **your own subscription** take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. 

+ In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select **Delete the resource group**, **Enter resource group name**, and then click **Delete**.
+ Using Azure PowerShell, `Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName`.
+ Using the CLI, `az group delete --name resourceGroupName`.

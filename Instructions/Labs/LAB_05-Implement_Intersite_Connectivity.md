# Lab 05 - Implement Intersite Connectivity

## Lab introduction

In this lab you explore communication between virtual networks. You implement virtual network peering and test connections. You will also create a custom route. 

This lab requires an Azure subscription. Your subscription type may affect the availability of features in this lab. You may change the region, but the steps are written using **East US**. 

## Estimated time: 50 minutes
    
## Lab scenario 

Your organization segments core IT apps and services (such as DNS and security services) from other parts of the business, including your manufacturing department. However, in some scenarios, apps and services in the core area need to communicate with apps and services in the manufacturing area. In this lab, you configure connectivity between the segmented areas. This is a common scenario for separating production from development or separating one subsidiary from another.  

## Interactive lab simulations

There are several interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

    ![Azure Portal showing Connection Troubleshoot settings.](../media/az104-lab05-connection-troubleshoot.png)

1. Select **Run diagnostic tests**.

    >**Note**: It may take a couple of minutes for the results to be returned. The screen selections will be greyed out while the results are being collected. Notice the **Connectivity test** shows **UnReachable**. This makes sense because the virtual machines are in different virtual networks. 

 
## Task 4: Configure virtual network peerings between virtual networks

In this task, you create a virtual network peering to enable communications between resources in the virtual networks. 

1. In the Azure portal, select for and select the `CoreServicesVnet` virtual network.

1. In CoreServicesVnet, under **Settings**, select **Peerings**.

1. On CoreServicesVnet | Peerings, select **+ Add**.

1. Use the information in the following table to create the peering.

| **Parameter**                                    | **Value**                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **This virtual network**                                       |                                       |
| Peering link name                             | `CoreServicesVnet-to-ManufacturingVnet` |
| Allow Allow CoreServicesVNet to access the peered virtual network            | selected (default)                       |
| Allow CoreServicesVNet to receive forwarded traffic from the peered virtual network | selected                       |
| Allow gateway in CoreServicesVNet to forward traffic to the peered virtual network | Not selected (default) |
| Enable CoreServicesVNet to use the peered virtual networks' remote gateway       | Not selected (default)                        |
| **Remote virtual network**                                   |                                       |
| Peering link name                             | `ManufacturingVnet-to-CoreServicesVnet` |
| Virtual network deployment model              | **Resource manager**                      |

| Subscription                                  | *your subscription*    |
| Virtual network                               | **ManufacturingVnet**                     |
| Allow ManufacturingVNet to access CoreServicesVNet  | selected (default)                       |
| Allow ManufacturingVNet to receive forwarded traffic from CoreServicesVNet | selected                        |
| Allow gateway in CoreServicesVNet to forward traffic to the peered virtual network | Not selected (default) |
| Enable ManufacturingVNet to use CoreServicesVNet's remote gateway       | Not selected (default)                        |

1. Review your settings and select **Add**.

    ![Screenshot of peering page.](../media/az104-lab05-peering.png)
 
1. In CoreServicesVnet | Peerings, verify that the **CoreServicesVnet-to-ManufacturingVnet** peering is listed. Refresh the page to ensure the **Peering status** is **Connected**.

1. Switch to the **ManufacturingVnet** and verify the **ManufacturingVnet-to-CoreServicesVnet** peering is listed. Ensure the **Peering status** is **Connected**. You may need to **Refresh** the page. 


## Task 5: Use Azure PowerShell to test the connection between virtual machines

In this task, you retest the connection between the virtual machines in different virtual networks. 

### Verify the private IP address of the CoreServicesVM

1. From the Azure portal, search for and select the `CoreServicesVM` virtual machine.

1. On the **Overview** blade, in the **Networking** section, record the **Private IP address** of the machine. You need this information to test the connection.
   
### Test the connection to the CoreServicesVM from the **ManufacturingVM**.

>**Did you know?** There are many ways to check connections. In this task, you use **Run command**. You could also continue to use Network Watcher. Or you could use a [Remote Desktop Connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/connect-rdp#connect-to-the-virtual-machine) to the access the virtual machine. Once connected, use **test-connection**. As you have time, give RDP a try. 

1. Switch to the `ManufacturingVM` virtual machine.

1. In the **Operations** blade, select the **Run command** blade.

1. Select **RunPowerShellScript** and run the **Test-NetConnection** command. Be sure to use the private IP address of the **CoreServicesVM**.

    ```Powershell
    Test-NetConnection <CoreServicesVM private IP address> -port 3389
    ```
1. It may take a couple of minutes for the script to time out. The top of the page shows an informational message *Script execution in progress.*

   
1. The test connection should succeed because peering has been configured. Your computer name and remote address in this graphic may be different. 
   
   ![PowerShell window with Test-NetConnection succeeded.](../media/az104-lab05-success.png)

## Task 6: Create a custom route 

In this task, you want to control network traffic between the perimeter subnet and the internal core services subnet. A virtual network appliance will be installed in the core services subnet and all traffic should be routed there. 

1. Search for select the `CoreServicesVnet`.

1. Select **Subnets** and then **+ Create**. Be sure to **Save** your changes. 

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | `perimeter` |
    | Subnet address range | `10.0.1.0/24`  |

   
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select `Route tables`, and then select **Create**. 

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | your subscription |
    | Resource group | `az104-rg5`  |
    | Region | **East US** |
    | Name | `rt-CoreServices` |
    | Propagate gateway routes | **No** |

1. After the route table deploys, select **Go to resource**.

1. Select **Routes** and then **+ Add**. Create a route from the future NVA to the CoreServices virtual network. 

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Route name | `PerimetertoCore` |
    | Destination type | **IP Addresses** |
    | Destination IP addresses | `10.0.0.0/16` (core services virtual network) |
    | Next hop type | **Virtual appliance** (notice your other choices) |
    | Next hop address | `10.0.1.7` (future NVA) |

1. Select **+ Add** when the route is completed. The last thing to do is associate the route with the subnet.

1. Select **Subnets** and then **Associate**. Complete the configuration.

    | Setting | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Virtual network | **CoreServicesVnet** |
    | Subnet | **Core** |    

>**Note**: You have created a user defined route to direct traffic from the DMZ to the new NVA.  

## Cleanup your resources

If you are working with **your own subscription** take a minute to delete the lab resources. This will ensure resources are freed up and cost is minimized. The easiest way to delete the lab resources is to delete the lab resource group. 

+ In the Azure portal, select the resource group, select **Delete the resource group**, **Enter resource group name**, and then click **Delete**.
+ Using Azure PowerShell, `Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name resourceGroupName`.
+ Using the CLI, `az group delete --name resourceGroupName`.


## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 

+ By default, resources in different virtual networks cannot communicate.
+ Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more virtual networks in Azure.
+ Peered virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes.
+ The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure.
+ System defined routes are automatically created for each subnet in a virtual network. User-defined routes override or add to the default system routes. 
+ Azure Network Watcher provides a suite of tools to monitor, diagnose, and view metrics and logs for Azure IaaS resources.
